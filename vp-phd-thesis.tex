%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any blank page inserted with
%% \cleardoublepage, use one of \clearemptydoublepage,
%% \clearplaindoublepage, \clearthesisdoublepage, or
%% \clearstandarddoublepage (to use the style currently in effect).
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  - Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal
%%    margins, one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).
%%  - For a rough copy (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced,
%%    with the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use
%%    the `draft' option.
%%  - The default global line spacing can be changed with one of the
%%    options `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.
%%  - Footnotes and marginal notes are all single-spaced by default, but
%%    can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document
%%    by using the option `standardspacednotes'.
%%  - The size of the margins can be changed with one of the options:
%%     . `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4" others),
%%     . `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%%     . `widemargins' (1 1/4" all),
%%     . `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).
%%  - The pagestyle of "cleared" pages (empty pages inserted in
%%    two-sided documents to put the next page on the right-hand side)
%%    can be set with one of the options `cleardoublepagestyleempty',
%%    `cleardoublepagestyleplain', or `cleardoublepagestylestandard'.
%%  - Any other standard option for the `report' document class can be
%%    used to override the default or draft settings (such as `10pt',
%%    `11pt', `12pt'), and standard LaTeX packages can be used to
%%    further customize the layout and/or formatting of the document.

%% *** Add any desired options. ***
\documentclass[oneandahalfspaced,twoside,12pt]{ut-thesis}

%% *** Add \usepackage declarations here. ***
%% The standard packages `geometry' and `setspace' are already loaded by
%% `ut-thesis' -- see their documentation for details of the features
%% they provide.  In particular, you may use the \geometry command here
%% to adjust the margins if none of the ut-thesis options are suitable
%% (see the `geometry' package for details).  You may also use the
%% \setstretch command to set the line spacing to a value other than
%% single, one-and-a-half, or double spaced (see the `setspace' package
%% for details).

\begin{document}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
%\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
%% *** Put your Abstract here. ***
%% (At most 150 words for M.Sc. or 350 words for Ph.D.)
The ability to estimate \textit{egomotion}, that is, to track one's own pose through an unknown environment, is at the heart of safe and reliable mobile autonomy. By inferring pose changes from sequential sensor measurements, egomotion estimation forms the basis of mapping and navigation pipelines, and permits mobile robots to self-localize within environments where external localization sources are intermittent or unavailable. 
Visual and inertial egomotion estimation, in particular, have become ubiquitous in mobile robotics due to the availability of high-quality, compact, and inexpensive sensors that capture rich representations of the world.
 To remain computationally tractable, `classical' visual-inertial pipelines (like visual odometry and visual SLAM) make simplifying assumptions that, while permitting reliable operation in ideal conditions, often lead to systematic error. In this thesis, we present several data-driven \textit{pseudo-sensors} that serve to augment conventional pipelines by inferring latent information from sensor data. Our approach retains much of the benefits of traditional pipelines, while leveraging high-capacity hyper-parametric models to extract complementary information that can be used to improve uncertainty quantification, correct for systematic bias, and improve robustness to difficult-to-model deleterious effects.
We validate our pseudo-sensors on several kilometres of sensor data collected in sundry settings such as urban roads, indoor labs, and planetary analogue sites in the Canadian High Arctic.
\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

\epigraph{The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way.

\clearpage
	

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed -- just a paragraph
%% formatted flush right (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\begin{dedication}
To all those who encouraged (or, at least, \textit{never discouraged}) my intellectual wanderlust.
\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% uncomment the following line.
\newpage  % separate pages for dedication and acknowledgements

%% Alternatively, if you leave both on the same page, it is probably a
%% good idea to add a bit of extra vertical space in between the two --
%% for example, as follows (adjust as desired).
%\vspace{.5in}  % vertical space between dedication and acknowledgements

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\begin{acknowledgements}
This document would not have been possible without the generous support and guidance of my supervisor\footnote{as well as all of my collaborators and academic mentors (special thanks to Lee)}, the perennial love of my family and friends\footnote{especially the support and encouragement of Elyse}, and the limitless patience of my lab mates\footnote{in humouring my insatiable need for debate and banter (special thanks to Lee)}. Thank you all.

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoffigures
%% You can add commands here to generate any other material that belongs
%% in the head matter (for example, List of Plates, Index of Symbols, or
%% List of Appendices).

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.

%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep     %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files.     %%
%%  Each chapter file should start with "\chapter{ChapterName}".      %%
%%  Note that using `\include' instead of `\input' will make each     %%
